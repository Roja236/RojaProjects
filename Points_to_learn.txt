1. Can we override static method?

ANS:  																							 		

		link for this question (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40400634/swift-override-static-method-compile-error)

		 In class B, the method list is a separate method from list in class A. They just share the same name, that's all.
		The parameters of the two list methods are actually different:
		// A.list
		static func list(completion: (_ result:[A]?) -> Void) {
		// B.list
		static func list(completion: (_ result:[B]?) -> Void) {
		A.list takes an argument of type (_ result: [A]?) -> Void while B.list takes a (_ result: [B]?) -> Void. The array 			type in the closure type's parameter list is different!
		So you're not overridding anything, you're just overloading.
		Note:
		static methods can never be overridden! If you want to override a method, use class instead of static.

		class A {
   		 class func get(completion: (_ result:A?) -> Void) {
      		completion (nil)
		    }
		}

		class B: A {
	  	  override class func get(completion: (_ result:B?) -> Void) {
   	    	 completion (nil)
    		}
		}	



Learned Points:  in story board (User interface) on the top right side(Utilities Panel) we have 
Library (UI objects), show standard editor (UI elements work place), show assistant editor ( will have previews on storyboard and viewController classes ),, show version editor(Shows the existing elements creation n display process details in XML form).

Hide or show navigator (files present on left side area) , Hide or show debug , Hide or showinspectors(here we can check the view or elements details.)

Will get, did set(need to explain)

1. Go to Editor --> Embed In --> Tab Bar Controller (or Navigation Controller) (first select any viewController / NavCont/TabBarCont/ Table/Collection view controllers)
